library(glue)

name_data <- 
  babynames %>% 
  filter(name == params$name)

n <- sum(name_data$n)

```

There have been **`r n`** children named `r params$name`. The name `r params$name` was most popular in `r most$year`, when `r most$n` children were named `r params$name`. `r params$name` is traditionally a `r sex` name.

```{r echo = FALSE}
name_data %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = prop, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = glue("Proportion of children named {params$name}"))
```
